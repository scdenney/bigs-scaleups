# Innovation Policy in Practice: Assessing Canada’s Business Innovation and Growth Support Framework

## Project Overview
This project examines the role and effectiveness of Canada’s **Business Innovation and Growth Support (BIGS)** framework in fostering firm scale-up. While scale-ups represent a small share of the firm population, they contribute disproportionately to employment, productivity, and innovation. Yet, evidence suggests they follow diverse growth paths and are unevenly supported by existing policy instruments.  

This study evaluates the impact of government supports on scale-up performance, situating the Canadian case in the broader international debate about how best to nurture high-growth firms.  

## Central Research Questions
- To what extent do Canadian innovation policies effectively support firm scaling?  
- How do scale-ups interact with government programs, and are effects heterogeneous across sectors and firm types?  
- What trade-offs emerge between employment-intensive and productivity-intensive scale-ups?  
- How should innovation policy be designed to better reflect firm diversity?  

## Methodology
- **Firm-level data**: Administrative and survey-based data on firm outcomes (employment, revenue, R&D, export activity).  
- **Quantitative analysis**: Fixed-effects regression models estimating the causal effect of receiving direct support.  

## Significance
Scale-ups are frequently assumed to be synonymous with technology firms, but Canadian evidence shows they emerge across diverse sectors and regions. This heterogeneity has profound implications for innovation policy design. By systematically evaluating BIGS, the project contributes to debates on how governments can best support high-growth firms while accounting for their varied trajectories.
